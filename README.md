# World Edit

Rising World editing tool.


## Introduction

This script is based on the original World Edit script by andyzee. The main difference with the original script are the commands.

Instead of `/we-select`, players must type `/we select` (no dash). Also, `/we-fillblock` has been replaced with `/we place` with extended arguments parameters.


## Installation

This modules has two dependencies, therefore you need to make sure both of them are properly installed before using this script!

### Using Git

Go to the `scripts` folder of your Rising World installation and type

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/RisingWorld/world-edit.git
```

### Manually

Download the Zip file for [this](https://github.com/RisingWorld/world-edit/archive/master.zip) repository and extract it to your Rising World's `scripts/world-edit` folder.

Download the Zip file for the [i18n](https://github.com/RisingWorld/i18n/archive/master.zip) sub-module, and extract it inside the `i18n` folder of this script.

Download the Zip file for the [command parser](https://github.com/RisingWorld/command-parser/archive/master.zip) sub-module, and extract it inside the `command-parser` folder of this script.

Download the Zip file for the [table-ext](https://github.com/RisingWorld/table-ext/archive/master.zip) sub-module, and extract it inside the `table-ext` folder of this script.

Your final script folder should look somewhat like this

```
./risingworld/scripts/world-edit
   ./command-parser
      ./parse-args.lua
   ./i18n
      ./i18n.lua
   ./lc_messages
      ./en.locale
      ./de.locale
   ./listeners
      ./commandListener.lua
      ./playerListener.lua
   ./table-ext
      ./table-ext.lua
   ./definition.xml
   ./blocks.lua
   ./config.properties
   ./security.lua
   ./worldedit.lua
```

(**Note**: there are more files, but only the necessary ones are shown, here.)


## Updating

Whenever world-edit is updated, you should also update your server. To keep up-to-date with the newest features, but more importantly to stay up-to-date with the most recent patches of Rising World, and correct any security issues. You may also consider automating this process. The updates will take effect only after server restart.

### Using Git

Go to your `world-edit` script folder and type

```
git fetch --recurse-submodules origin master
```

### Manually

Repeat manual installation process, overwrite any existing files.
